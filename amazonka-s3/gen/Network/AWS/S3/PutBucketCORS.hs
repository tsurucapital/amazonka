--
-- Sets the @cors@ configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.
--
--
-- To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the @s3:PutBucketCORS@ action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.
--
-- You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is @http://www.example.com@ to access your Amazon S3 bucket at @my.example.bucket.com@ by using the browser's @XMLHttpRequest@ capability.
--
-- To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the @cors@ subresource to the bucket. The @cors@ subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.
--
-- When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the @cors@ configuration on the bucket and uses the first @CORSRule@ rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:
--
--     * The request's @Origin@ header must match @AllowedOrigin@ elements.
--
--     * The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the @Access-Control-Request-Method@ header in case of a pre-flight @OPTIONS@ request must be one of the @AllowedMethod@ elements.
--
--     * Every header specified in the @Access-Control-Request-Headers@ request header of a pre-flight request must match an @AllowedHeader@ element.
--

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pbcContentMD5' - The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. This header must be used as a message integrity check to verify that the request body was not corrupted in transit. For more information, go to <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt RFC 1864.>  For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.
--
-- * 'pbcExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'pbcBucket' - Specifies the bucket impacted by the @cors@ configuration.
--
-- * 'pbcCORSConfiguration' - Describes the cross-origin access configuration for objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
