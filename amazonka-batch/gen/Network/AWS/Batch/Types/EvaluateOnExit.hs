-- | Creates a value of 'EvaluateOnExit' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eoeOnExitCode' - Contains a glob pattern to match against the decimal representation of the @ExitCode@ returned for a job. The patten can be up to 512 characters long, can contain only numbers, and can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.
--
-- * 'eoeOnReason' - Contains a glob pattern to match against the @Reason@ returned for a job. The patten can be up to 512 characters long, can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (spaces, tabs), and can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.
--
-- * 'eoeOnStatusReason' - Contains a glob pattern to match against the @StatusReason@ returned for a job. The patten can be up to 512 characters long, can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (spaces, tabs). and can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.
--
-- * 'eoeAction' - Specifies the action to take if all of the specified conditions (@onStatusReason@ , @onReason@ , and @onExitCode@ ) are met. The values are not case sensitive.
