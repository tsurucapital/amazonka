--
-- Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header @x-amz-copy-source@ in your request and a byte range by adding the request header @x-amz-copy-source-range@ in your request.
--
--
-- The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html Quick Facts> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.
--
-- For more information about using the @UploadPartCopy@ operation, see the following:
--
--     * For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
--     * For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html Multipart Upload API and Permissions> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
--     * For information about copying objects using a single atomic operation vs. the multipart upload, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html Operations on Objects> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
--     * For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html CopyObject> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html UploadPart> .
--
--
--
-- Note the following additional considerations about the request headers @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@ , @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@ , @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@ , and @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@ :
--
--
--
--     * __Consideration 1__ - If both of the @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@ and @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@ headers are present in the request as follows:
--
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@ condition evaluates to @true@ , and;
--
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@ condition evaluates to @false@ ;
--
-- Amazon S3 returns @200 OK@ and copies the data.
--
--     * __Consideration 2__ - If both of the @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@ and @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@ headers are present in the request as follows:
--
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@ condition evaluates to @false@ , and;
--
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@ condition evaluates to @true@ ;
--
-- Amazon S3 returns @412 Precondition Failed@ response code.
--
--
--
-- __Versioning__
--
-- If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, @x-amz-copy-source@ identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the @x-amz-copy-source@ , Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the @x-amz-copy-source@ and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the @x-amz-copy-source@ .
--
-- You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the @versionId@ subresource as shown in the following example:
--
-- @x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id@
--
-- __Special Errors__
--
--     *     * /Code: NoSuchUpload/
--
--     * /Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed./
--
--     * /HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found/
--
--
--
--     *     * /Code: InvalidRequest/
--
--     * /Cause: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy source./
--
--     * /HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request/

-- | Creates a value of 'UploadPartCopy' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceIfModifiedSince' - Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince' - Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceRange' - The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceSSECustomerKeyMD5' - Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceIfNoneMatch' - Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.
--
-- * 'upcSSECustomerAlgorithm' - Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
--
-- * 'upcSSECustomerKey' - Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the @x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm@ header. This must be the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload request.
--
-- * 'upcRequestPayer' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceIfMatch' - Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.
--
-- * 'upcExpectedSourceBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected source bucket owner. If the source bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'upcSSECustomerKeyMD5' - Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceSSECustomerKey' - Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The encryption key provided in this header must be one that was used when the source object was created.
--
-- * 'upcCopySourceSSECustomerAlgorithm' - Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example, AES256).
--
-- * 'upcExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected destination bucket owner. If the destination bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'upcBucket' - The bucket name. When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ .s3-accesspoint./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html Using Access Points> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ . When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ ./outpostID/ .s3-outposts./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html Using S3 on Outposts> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'upcCopySource' - Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-points.html access point> :     * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object @reports/january.pdf@ from the bucket @awsexamplebucket@ , use @awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf@ . The value must be URL encoded.     * For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format @arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>@ . For example, to copy the object @reports/january.pdf@ through access point @my-access-point@ owned by account @123456789012@ in Region @us-west-2@ , use the URL encoding of @arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf@ . The value must be URL encoded. Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format @arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>@ . For example, to copy the object @reports/january.pdf@ through outpost @my-outpost@ owned by account @123456789012@ in Region @us-west-2@ , use the URL encoding of @arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf@ . The value must be URL encoded.  To copy a specific version of an object, append @?versionId=<version-id>@ to the value (for example, @awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893@ ). If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.
--
-- * 'upcKey' - Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.
--
-- * 'upcPartNumber' - Part number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.
--
-- * 'upcUploadId' - Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being copied.

Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format @arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>@ . For example, to copy the object @reports/january.pdf@ through outpost @my-outpost@ owned by account @123456789012@ in Region @us-west-2@ , use the URL encoding of @arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf@ . The value must be URL encoded.  To copy a specific version of an object, append @?versionId=<version-id>@ to the value (for example, @awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893@ ). If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.
