-- | Creates a value of 'AttemptContainerDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'acdNetworkInterfaces' - The network interfaces associated with the job attempt.
--
-- * 'acdTaskARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon ECS task that is associated with the job attempt. Each container attempt receives a task ARN when they reach the @STARTING@ status.
--
-- * 'acdContainerInstanceARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon ECS container instance that hosts the job attempt.
--
-- * 'acdReason' - A short (255 max characters) human-readable string to provide additional details about a running or stopped container.
--
-- * 'acdLogStreamName' - The name of the CloudWatch Logs log stream associated with the container. The log group for AWS Batch jobs is @/aws/batch/job@ . Each container attempt receives a log stream name when they reach the @RUNNING@ status.
--
-- * 'acdExitCode' - The exit code for the job attempt. A non-zero exit code is considered a failure.
