-- Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid XML. Be sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

-- | Creates a value of 'ListObjects' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'loPrefix' - Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.
--
-- * 'loEncodingType' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'loRequestPayer' - Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the list objects request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.
--
-- * 'loMarker' - Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.
--
-- * 'loMaxKeys' - Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default the API returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.
--
-- * 'loDelimiter' - A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.
--
-- * 'loExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'loBucket' - The name of the bucket containing the objects. When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ .s3-accesspoint./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html Using Access Points> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ . When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ ./outpostID/ .s3-outposts./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html Using S3 on Outposts> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .

-- | Creates a value of 'ListObjectsResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lorsContents' - Metadata about each object returned.
--
-- * 'lorsPrefix' - Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.
--
-- * 'lorsCommonPrefixes' - All of the keys rolled up in a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.  A response can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify a delimiter. CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by the delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. All of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.
--
-- * 'lorsEncodingType' - Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the response.
--
-- * 'lorsName' - The bucket name.
--
-- * 'lorsMarker' - Indicates where in the bucket listing begins. Marker is included in the response if it was sent with the request.
--
-- * 'lorsNextMarker' - When response is truncated (the IsTruncated element value in the response is true), you can use the key name in this field as marker in the subsequent request to get next set of objects. Amazon S3 lists objects in alphabetical order Note: This element is returned only if you have delimiter request parameter specified. If response does not include the NextMarker and it is truncated, you can use the value of the last Key in the response as the marker in the subsequent request to get the next set of object keys.
--
-- * 'lorsMaxKeys' - The maximum number of keys returned in the response body.
--
-- * 'lorsIsTruncated' - A flag that indicates whether Amazon S3 returned all of the results that satisfied the search criteria.
--
-- * 'lorsDelimiter' - Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the @CommonPrefixes@ collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result counts as only one return against the @MaxKeys@ value.
--
-- * 'lorsResponseStatus' - -- | The response status code.
