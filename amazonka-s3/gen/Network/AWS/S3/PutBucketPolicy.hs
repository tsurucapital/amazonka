-- Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the @PutBucketPolicy@ permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.
--
--
-- If you don't have @PutBucketPolicy@ permissions, Amazon S3 returns a @403 Access Denied@ error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a @405 Method Not Allowed@ error.
--
-- /Important:/ As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.
--

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pbpConfirmRemoveSelfBucketAccess' - Set this parameter to true to confirm that you want to remove your permissions to change this bucket policy in the future.
--
-- * 'pbpContentMD5' - The MD5 hash of the request body. For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.
--
-- * 'pbpExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'pbpBucket' - The name of the bucket.
--
-- * 'pbpPolicy' - The bucket policy as a JSON document.
