--
-- Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html Replication> in the /Amazon S3 Developer Guide/ .
--
--
-- Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information.
--
-- A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.
--
-- To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: @DeleteMarkerReplication@ , @Status@ , and @Priority@ .
--
-- For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html Using Versioning> .
--
-- By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html Specifying Permissions in a Policy> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources> .
--
-- __Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects__
--
-- By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. To replicate AWS KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: @SourceSelectionCriteria@ , @SseKmsEncryptedObjects@ , @Status@ , @EncryptionConfiguration@ , and @ReplicaKmsKeyID@ . For information about replication configuration, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using CMKs stored in AWS KMS> .
--
-- For information on @PutBucketReplication@ errors, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList List of replication-related error codes>

-- The following operations are related to @PutBucketReplication@ :

-- | Creates a value of 'PutBucketReplication' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pbrToken' - A token to allow Object Lock to be enabled for an existing bucket.
--
-- * 'pbrContentMD5' - The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this header as a message integrity check to verify that the request body was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt RFC 1864> . For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.
--
-- * 'pbrExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'pbrBucket' - The name of the bucket
--
-- * 'pbrReplicationConfiguration' - Undocumented member.
