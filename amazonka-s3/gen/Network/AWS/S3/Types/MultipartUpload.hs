-- | Creates a value of 'MultipartUpload' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'muInitiated' - Date and time at which the multipart upload was initiated.
--
-- * 'muInitiator' - Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.
--
-- * 'muOwner' - Specifies the owner of the object that is part of the multipart upload.
--
-- * 'muKey' - Key of the object for which the multipart upload was initiated.
--
-- * 'muStorageClass' - The class of storage used to store the object.
--
-- * 'muUploadId' - Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.
