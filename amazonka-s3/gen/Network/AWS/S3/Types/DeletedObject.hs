-- | Creates a value of 'DeletedObject' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dVersionId' - The version ID of the deleted object.
--
-- * 'dDeleteMarker' - Specifies whether the versioned object that was permanently deleted was (true) or was not (false) a delete marker. In a simple DELETE, this header indicates whether (true) or not (false) a delete marker was created.
--
-- * 'dDeleteMarkerVersionId' - The version ID of the delete marker created as a result of the DELETE operation. If you delete a specific object version, the value returned by this header is the version ID of the object version deleted.
--
-- * 'dKey' - The name of the deleted object.
