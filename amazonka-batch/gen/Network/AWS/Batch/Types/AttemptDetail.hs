-- | Creates a value of 'AttemptDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'adStoppedAt' - The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when the attempt was stopped (when the attempt transitioned from the @RUNNING@ state to a terminal state, such as @SUCCEEDED@ or @FAILED@ ).
--
-- * 'adStartedAt' - The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when the attempt was started (when the attempt transitioned from the @STARTING@ state to the @RUNNING@ state).
--
-- * 'adContainer' - Details about the container in this job attempt.
--
-- * 'adStatusReason' - A short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the job attempt.
