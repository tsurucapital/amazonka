-- Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.
--
--
-- For information about replication configuration, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html Replication> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- This operation requires permissions for the @s3:GetReplicationConfiguration@ action. For more information about permissions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html Using Bucket Policies and User Policies> .
--
-- If you include the @Filter@ element in a replication configuration, you must also include the @DeleteMarkerReplication@ and @Priority@ elements. The response also returns those elements.
--
-- For information about @GetBucketReplication@ errors, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList List of replication-related error codes>
