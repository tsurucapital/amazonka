-- This operation removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a @200 OK@ response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a @200 OK@ response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a @404@ response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.
--
--
-- This DELETE operation requires the @S3:DeleteBucketWebsite@ permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the @S3:DeleteBucketWebsite@ permission.
