-- Returns the versioning state of a bucket.
--
--
-- To retrieve the versioning state of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.
--
-- This implementation also returns the MFA Delete status of the versioning state. If the MFA Delete status is @enabled@ , the bucket owner must use an authentication device to change the versioning state of the bucket.
