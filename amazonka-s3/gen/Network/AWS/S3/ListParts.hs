-- Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload. This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending the initiate multipart upload request (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html CreateMultipartUpload> ). This request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of parts returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned by specifying the @max-parts@ request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an @IsTruncated@ field with the value of true, and a @NextPartNumberMarker@ element. In subsequent @ListParts@ requests you can include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value to the @NextPartNumberMarker@ field value from the previous response.

-- | Creates a value of 'ListParts' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lpMaxParts' - Sets the maximum number of parts to return.
--
-- * 'lpRequestPayer' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'lpPartNumberMarker' - Specifies the part after which listing should begin. Only parts with higher part numbers will be listed.
--
-- * 'lpExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'lpBucket' - The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.  When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ .s3-accesspoint./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html Using Access Points> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ . When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form /AccessPointName/ -/AccountId/ ./outpostID/ .s3-outposts./Region/ .amazonaws.com. When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name.

-- * 'lpKey' - Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

--
-- * 'lprsMaxParts' - Maximum number of parts that were allowed in the response.
--

--
-- * 'lprsAbortDate' - If the bucket has a lifecycle rule configured with an action to abort incomplete multipart uploads and the prefix in the lifecycle rule matches the object name in the request, then the response includes this header indicating when the initiated multipart upload will become eligible for abort operation.

--
-- * 'lprsAbortRuleId' - This header is returned along with the @x-amz-abort-date@ header. It identifies applicable lifecycle configuration rule that defines the action to abort incomplete multipart uploads.
--
-- * 'lprsOwner' - Container element that identifies the object owner, after the object is created. If multipart upload is initiated by an IAM user, this element provides the parent account ID and display name.
--

--
-- * 'lprsStorageClass' - Class of storage (STANDARD or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY) used to store the uploaded object.
--
-- * 'lprsIsTruncated' - Indicates whether the returned list of parts is truncated. A true value indicates that the list was truncated. A list can be truncated if the number of parts exceeds the limit returned in the MaxParts element.
