--
-- This operation uses the @encryption@ subresource to configure default encryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Key for an existing bucket.
--
--
-- Default encryption for a bucket can use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS customer master keys (SSE-KMS). If you specify default encryption using SSE-KMS, you can also configure Amazon S3 Bucket Key. For information about default encryption, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html Amazon S3 default bucket encryption> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ . For more information about S3 Bucket Keys, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html Amazon S3 Bucket Keys> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- /Important:/ This operation requires AWS Signature Version 4. For more information, see <sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)> .
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the @s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration@ action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources> in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

-- | Creates a value of 'PutBucketEncryption' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pbeContentMD5' - The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the server-side encryption configuration. For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.
--
-- * 'pbeExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'pbeBucket' - Specifies default encryption for a bucket using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer master keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). For information about the Amazon S3 default encryption feature, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
