-- | Creates a value of 'ReplicationRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rrDeleteMarkerReplication' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'rrPriority' - The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.  For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html Replication> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'rrPrefix' - An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string.
--
-- * 'rrExistingObjectReplication' -
--
-- * 'rrId' - A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.
--
-- * 'rrFilter' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'rrSourceSelectionCriteria' - A container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects that you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or disable the replication of these objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports only the filter that you can specify for objects created with server-side encryption using a customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).
--
-- * 'rrStatus' - Specifies whether the rule is enabled.
--
-- * 'rrDestination' - A container for information about the replication destination and its configurations including enabling the S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).
