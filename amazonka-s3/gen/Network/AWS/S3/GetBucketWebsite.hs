-- Returns the website configuration for a bucket. To host website on Amazon S3, you can configure a bucket as website by adding a website configuration. For more information about hosting websites, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html Hosting Websites on Amazon S3> .
--
--
-- This GET operation requires the @S3:GetBucketWebsite@ permission. By default, only the bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration. However, bucket owners can allow other users to read the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the @S3:GetBucketWebsite@ permission.
