-- | Creates a value of 'JobSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jsStoppedAt' - The Unix timestamp for when the job was stopped (when the job transitioned from the @RUNNING@ state to a terminal state, such as @SUCCEEDED@ or @FAILED@ ).
--
-- * 'jsStatus' - The current status for the job.
--
-- * 'jsJobARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job.
--
-- * 'jsCreatedAt' - The Unix timestamp for when the job was created. For non-array jobs and parent array jobs, this is when the job entered the @SUBMITTED@ state (at the time 'SubmitJob' was called). For array child jobs, this is when the child job was spawned by its parent and entered the @PENDING@ state.
--
-- * 'jsStartedAt' - The Unix timestamp for when the job was started (when the job transitioned from the @STARTING@ state to the @RUNNING@ state).
--
-- * 'jsContainer' - An object representing the details of the container that is associated with the job.
--
-- * 'jsStatusReason' - A short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the job.
--
-- * 'jsArrayProperties' - The array properties of the job, if it is an array job.
--
-- * 'jsNodeProperties' - The node properties for a single node in a job summary list.
--
-- * 'jsJobId' - The ID of the job.
--
-- * 'jsJobName' - The name of the job.
