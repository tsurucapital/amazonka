-- Sets the tags for a bucket.
--
--
-- Use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html Cost Allocation and Tagging> .
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the @s3:PutBucketTagging@ action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources> .

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pbtContentMD5' - The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this header as a message integrity check to verify that the request body was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt RFC 1864> . For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.
--
-- * 'pbtExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'pbtBucket' - The bucket name.
--
-- * 'pbtTagging' - Container for the @TagSet@ and @Tag@ elements.
