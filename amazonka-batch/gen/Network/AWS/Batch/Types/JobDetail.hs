-- | Creates a value of 'JobDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jdStoppedAt' - The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when the job was stopped (when the job transitioned from the @RUNNING@ state to a terminal state, such as @SUCCEEDED@ or @FAILED@ ).
--
-- * 'jdJobARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job.
--
-- * 'jdPropagateTags' - Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the @FAILED@ state.
--
-- * 'jdCreatedAt' - The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when the job was created. For non-array jobs and parent array jobs, this is when the job entered the @SUBMITTED@ state (at the time 'SubmitJob' was called). For array child jobs, this is when the child job was spawned by its parent and entered the @PENDING@ state.
--
-- * 'jdRetryStrategy' - The retry strategy to use for this job if an attempt fails.
--
-- * 'jdAttempts' - A list of job attempts associated with this job.
--
-- * 'jdPlatformCapabilities' - The platform capabilities required by the job definition. If no value is specified, it defaults to @EC2@ . Jobs run on Fargate resources specify @FARGATE@ .
--
-- * 'jdStartedAt' - The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when the job was started (when the job transitioned from the @STARTING@ state to the @RUNNING@ state). This parameter isn't provided for child jobs of array jobs or multi-node parallel jobs.
--
-- * 'jdDependsOn' - A list of job IDs that this job depends on.
--
-- * 'jdContainer' - An object representing the details of the container that's associated with the job.
--
-- * 'jdNodeDetails' - An object representing the details of a node that is associated with a multi-node parallel job.
--
-- * 'jdParameters' - Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter substitution placeholders or override any corresponding parameter defaults from the job definition.
--
-- * 'jdStatusReason' - A short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the job.
--
-- * 'jdArrayProperties' - The array properties of the job, if it is an array job.
--
-- * 'jdTimeout' - The timeout configuration for the job.
--
-- * 'jdNodeProperties' - An object representing the node properties of a multi-node parallel job.
--
-- * 'jdTags' - The tags applied to the job.
--
-- * 'jdJobName' - The name of the job.
--
-- * 'jdJobId' - The ID for the job.
--
-- * 'jdJobQueue' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue that the job is associated with.
--
-- * 'jdStatus' - The current status for the job.
--
-- * 'jdJobDefinition' - The job definition that is used by this job.
