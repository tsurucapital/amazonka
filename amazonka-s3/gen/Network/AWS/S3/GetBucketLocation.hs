-- Returns the Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket's Region using the @LocationConstraint@ request parameter in a @CreateBucket@ request. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html CreateBucket> .

-- To use this implementation of the operation, you must be the bucket owner.
