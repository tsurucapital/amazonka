-- This implementation of the DELETE operation removes default encryption from the bucket. For information about the Amazon S3 default encryption feature, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the @s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration@ action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations> and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
