-- Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html Using ACLs> . To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have @WRITE_ACP@ permission.
--
--
-- You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:
--
--     * Specify the ACL in the request body
--
--     * Specify permissions using request headers
--
--
--
-- Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.
--
-- __Access Permissions__
--
-- You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:
--
--     * Specify a canned ACL with the @x-amz-acl@ request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as /canned ACLs/ . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of @x-amz-acl@ . If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL Canned ACL> .
--
--     * Specify access permissions explicitly with the @x-amz-grant-read@ , @x-amz-grant-read-acp@ , @x-amz-grant-write-acp@ , and @x-amz-grant-full-control@ headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the @x-amz-acl@ header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html Access Control List (ACL) Overview> .
--
-- You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:
--
--     * @id@ – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account
--
--     * @uri@ – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
--
--     * @emailAddress@ – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account
--
--
--
-- For example, the following @x-amz-grant-write@ header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.
--
-- @x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", id="111122223333", id="555566667777" @
--
--
--
-- You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.
--
-- __Grantee Values__
--
-- You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:
--
--     * By the person's ID:
--
-- @<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>@
--
-- DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request
--
--     * By URI:
--
-- @<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>@
--
--     * By Email address:
--
-- @<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>@
--
-- The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

For more information, go to <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt RFC 1864.>  For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

--
-- * 'pbaACL' - The canned ACL to apply to the bucket.
--
-- * 'pbaExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
