--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pbocContentMD5' - The MD5 hash of the @OwnershipControls@ request body.  For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.
--
-- * 'pbocExpectedBucketOwner' - The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP @403 (Access Denied)@ error.
--
-- * 'pbocBucket' - The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose @OwnershipControls@ you want to set.
--
-- * 'pbocOwnershipControls' - The @OwnershipControls@ (BucketOwnerPreferred or ObjectWriter) that you want to apply to this Amazon S3 bucket.
